      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>Hi!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kean Yeung and I am a 1A Mechanical Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo. My academic interests span a very broad range of topics from mechanical design to embedded systems to Arduino, but "automation for efficient systems" would sum up my passions the best.</p>
        <p>I have worked in different roles, including production, finance, and engineering, and what I love most about every experience is to be able to connect and collaborate with many different people, while working on projects that I can be proud about in the end. I am currently working at Stackpole International in Hamilton as a Design Automation Engineer, and a large portion of my work revolves around building efficient mechatronic systems with mechanical design and PLC programming. </p>
        <p> Outside of work, I am also a very avid music listener. I've always loved exploring music from all genres, and finding a community of people with a similar interest in music prompted me to take part in the "Album A Day" challenge. From alternative rock to hip-hop to classical music, I've always loved the different emotions that music has brought for me. Some of my favorite albums include: When The Pawn... by Fiona Apple, Currents by Tame Impala, and Nevermind by Nirvana. </p>
      <p>If I am not listening to a new album or vibing to my favorite tunes, I like to entertain myself with some other hobbies of mine, including longboarding, playing badminton, thrifting, or meeting and connecting with new people! </p>
        <p>The last point there is by far my favorite hobby, so I'd love to connect with you!
